Context in design is something that I am very interested in, and this geofilter represents the epicenter of Washington Heights culture. The 'bodega' as it is known in the neighborhood, is a locally run convenience store which is unique to New York City, specifically the upper Manhattan Washington Heights area where locals can go and be supplied with items familiar to their native countries. The bodega represents home and comfort, welcoming both local residents, and outside visitors alike.
</p><p>This geofilter is a symbol of what we all know as the one place in the city that welcomes all. If you're in the Washington Heights area in NYC, use it and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=IsThatJeff">tweet me a photo</a>, I'd love to see!
