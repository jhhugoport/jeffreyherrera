<p>
Hands for Trump is a project that touches on current socio-political issues in a snarky, but unwavering fashion and serves as a way to donate to charities through protest art that you can wear. Typeset in the fitting Akzidenz-Grotesk BQ Super (yes, we think a lot of the current climate is grotesque), we have designed these pieces to represent your views, while letting others around you know that you are an ally. Let's wear our support.

The current administration's rhetoric is certainly regression rather than its antonym. Each charity we've curated stands for the progression of the group it represents and mankind. We believe in these causes and their respective purposes. We donated to ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood and the Trans Lifeline.

<p>
	Akzidenz-Grotesk has always been a favorite of mine for it's tight bold characters. For the <strikethrough>Nasty</strikethrough> Woman design, I matched the curves and optically proportioned the symbol in order to get an insight to way the rest of the typeface was built.
