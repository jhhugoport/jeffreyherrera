<h5 style="color: #165EF6">Background</h5>
<p>
Your Screen Is Not Dead is a weekly podcast all about film. Every week the hosts announce a film to watch, then they talk about it.
Find them <a href="http://www.yourscreenisnotdead.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h5 style="color: #165EF6">Unique Features</h5>
<p>To further the concept of VHS and film, animations on the website create chromatic aberration and a glitch effect on text, a VHS loading screen, and tracking lines along the bottom of the screen, all through css animation for speedy load times. (above)</p>
<p>In order to help the hosts feature their episodes on social media posts every week, I created a rollover state with visual flair that could serve as a tool to generate episode promotion. The hosts just need to screenshot the rollover state and post! (below)</p>

<h5 style="color: #165EF6">Collateral</h5>
<p>For the launch, we created a set of buttons and a thank you card. We put a button on each card, and once it was taken off the card, it revealed the QR code for the podcast's website.</p>
<p>The launch event was a success, and attendees went away with something tangible to remind them to listen in.</p>
