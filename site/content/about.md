# Anything that can be&nbsp;changed, can be&nbsp;designed.
<p class="caption">– Marty Neumeier</p>

My interest in design is rooted in the intersection of form and narrative. Story separates design from decoration– adding intent and empathy to a project. It influences behavior and, as creators, we are responsible for translating the elements of an idea into something recognizable. The goal is, and will always be, to enrich the lives of the world around us, and make a positive impact through the design choices we make.

Now, off to try and make my love for tacos sound that poetic.
